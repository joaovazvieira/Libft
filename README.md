Project Title: Custom C Library Development

Project Description:
In this project, I explore the world of C programming and create your own custom C library.
This library will serve as a valuable resource for my future C projects, allowing me to gain a deeper understanding of 'C' functionality and enhance my programming skills.
The primary objective is to implement essential functions commonly found in 'C' standard library while gaining hands-on experience.

Project Objectives:

Understanding C Functions: 
Acquire a comprehensive understanding of 'C' standard library functions and how they work.

Library Development: 
Develop a custom C library that includes commonly used functions, data structures, and utilities.
These functions can encompass tasks like string manipulation, memory management, data sorting, and more.
